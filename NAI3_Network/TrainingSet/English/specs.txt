History

Interior of Spec's in Montrose
The original Spec's opened in 1962 in the Fifth Ward, Houston. Carroll B. "Spec" Jackson and Carolynn Jackson founded the store. "Spec" Jackson wanted to work for himself and make enough money so Carolynn would not have to work. The store's name originated from his nickname, "Spec's," referring to his eye spectacles. "Spec" Jackson spent $7,000 to have his first store opened.[6]

Originally Spec's sold only beer and liquor and functioned as a neighborhood liquor store.[6] 96% of the inventory consisted of liquor.[7] After several years the operations produced a consistent profit. "Spec" Jackson decided to expand the chain. Ten years after the owner decided to expand, Spec's had 16 Greater Houston locations.[6]

In 1996 the Jacksons died, with one dying six months after the other. Lindy Rydman, the daughter of the Jacksons, and her husband John Rydman took ownership of the chain. After a customer suggested that Spec's carry snacks, Spec's began to offer delicatessen items. In 2002 the chain had 475 employees and 24 stores in Greater Houston.[6]

In 2008 Spec's acquired Palms Liquor in Galveston, giving the chain its first Galveston store.[8] In 2009 Spec's announced plans to open a store in Live Oak, giving the chain its first store in Greater San Antonio.[2] After the City of Killeen legalized the sale of packaged liquor at the end of 2010, Spec's scheduled the opening of its Killeen store on August 5, 2011.[9] The chain's first location in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex opened on December 19, 2011 in Dallas.[10] Goody Goody Liquor, a family liquor store company based in Dallas, responded to Spec's entering the DFW market by entering the Houston market.[11]

For eight consecutive years, the Houston Press gave Spec's the "Best Liquor Store" award.[12]
